<h1><strong>Project Option 2: Blog Application </strong></h1>

<h2>Database</h2> The database has three tables, there is a table for the blog posts and a table for authors. 
Since there are many authors that can make many blog posts the data is normalized and there is a third table containing the post id and author ids.
The db.py file is used to create the database where the schema is defined in schema.sql.
